      <p>I can't believe we've known each other for more than 4 years now. Feels like it was only yesterday that we were nerding out over each other MAL lists <img class="emote" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/927579520205209600.webp"></p>
      <p>Speaking of which. For all the times you've denied being a weeb over the past few years, I can't believe your MAL username literally is Tasnim_the_weeb <img class="emote" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/721543714555560018.webp"> . Maybe now that you're finally 5, you'll be less shy about embracing your inner weeb.</p>

        Good luck with Uni. We spent a lot of time trying to find laptops that would work well for you until Goofed picked this one out so I hope you like it. If not, don't listen to Scott or Nat, you know who to ban <img class="emote" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/896330734963425320.webp">

      <p>Happy birthday again! Here's to more fun times in the future hanging out in VCs, bullying Goofed and talking about weeb shit <img class="emote" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/937117696523382824.webp"></p>

      <p>P.S: There is a vaporeon hidden somewhere in this card. Just thought i'd let you know <img class="emote" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/875870038442278972.webp"></p>
